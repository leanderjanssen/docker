## Exercise 1 â€“ Running a container

1. On your terminal type:
```
docker run ubuntu:14.04 echo "Hello World"
```

2. Then type:
```
docker run ubuntu:14.04 ps -ef
```
Observe the output. And notice the much faster execution time. This is due to the fact that the image is now available locally. Also notice that within the container the `ps -ef` command was running as PID 1

3. List running containers by typing:
```
docker ps
```
There should not be running any active containers.
4. List both running and stopped containers:
```
docker ps -a
```
5. Create a container and connect to STDIN and a Terminal
```
docker run -i -t ubuntu:14.04 bash
```
Notice that the prompt has changed to something like `root@a23213...:/#`
 * Inside this container create a file called `testfile`
```
touch testfile
```
 Run `ls` to verify that the file has been created.
 * Exit the container by typing:
```
exit
```
6. List the running containers again and notice how there is nothing running

7. Create another container using the same `docker run` command as in step 5.
* Run `ls` again and try to find the file `testfile` that you created previously.  

    Did you find it? Why not?

8. Run a container in detached mode
```
docker run -d ubuntu:14.04 ping 127.0.0.1 -c 50
```
 * List the running containers using `docker ps`  
You should see a container running that is pinging 127.0.0.1.
 * Wait for about a minute and run `docker ps` again.  
 You'll notice that the container has stopped.  
 Why do you think it has stopped?

9. Exposing ports to the outside world
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx nginx:alpine
```
* Open a webbrowser on your laptop and enter the public ip of your AWS instance in the url field, e.g. `http://52.208.236.81`  
nginx should welcome you.

10. Execute an additional proces in a running container:
```
docker exec -it nginx /bin/sh
```
Notice how the prompt changes to `/ #`  
You're now inside the container that runs nginx.  
Try to run the `ps -ef` command and notice the output.  
Exit out of the container by typing `exit`  
Is the container still running? Why is that?

11. Show container logs
```
docker logs nginx
```
You should see the logs of the `nginx` container.  
Notice the log entries of you accessing the nginx webserver with your browser.


12. Stopping a container
```
docker stop nginx
```
Verify that the container stopped.

13. Start a container again
```
docker start nginx
```
And verify if it indeed runs again.

14. Remove a container
```
docker rm nginx
```
Oops, that didn't work.
* However, you can remove a running container by force:
```
docker rm -f nginx
```

15. Cleaning up all stopped containers using a single command
```
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```
